As part of the Advanced Software Engineering course, students are given the task of writing a pet project of our choice and applying concepts of advanced software engineering to this project. As part of my submission I decided to take a concept from physics and to write a program in Python that can generate animations of a coupled system of oscillators with either fixed or open boundary conditions. Below is an example of the animations produced:

The main code is in the parent folder.

## Tasks

### 1. UML diagrams
These are included in the folder...

### 2. Metrics
This has been done using sonarqube and the report is available at...

### Clean Code Development

Variable names were explicit and descriptive and easy to speak. tabLength for length of the table. numberMasses for number of masses, etc. Descriptive function names

The DRY principle was followed. All repetitive tasks, or tasks which were common to more than one class, were written into functions.

Each function is focused and does only what it is required to do.

No unnecessary comments

Error handling...

### Build Management
This was done using pybuilder. It created a setup.py file which is included in the repo.

### Continuous Delievery
This was done with Travis. Here is the report:

### Functional programming
