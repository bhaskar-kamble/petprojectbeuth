# Animating the normal modes of a coupled oscillator system



As part of the Advanced Software Engineering course at the Beuth Hochschule fuer Technik, Berlin, students are required to write a project of their choice and apply the concepts of advanced software engineering taught in this course. As part of my submission, I wrote a Python program to generate animations of a coupled system of oscillators with either fixed or open boundary conditions. Below is an example of the animations produced:

The main code is in the parent folder (NormalModesAnimator.py).


All details relating to the specific tasks of the project and my solutions can be found in the repo [Wiki](https://github.com/bhaskar-kamble/petprojectbeuth/wiki).
